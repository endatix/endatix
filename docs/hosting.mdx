## Health Checks

Endatix provides built-in support for health checks, which are automatically configured when you use the default configuration. You can customize health checks using the `WithHealthChecks` method:

```csharp
builder.Host.ConfigureEndatix(endatix => endatix
    .WithHealthChecks(health => health
        .UseDefaults() // Adds a basic self-check
        .AddCheck("custom-check", () => HealthCheckResult.Healthy("Custom check is healthy"));
```

Health checks are automatically exposed at the `/health` endpoint. You can customize the health checks middleware using the `WithHealthChecksMiddleware` method:

```csharp
app.UseEndatixMiddleware(middleware => middleware
    .WithHealthChecksMiddleware(options => {
        options.Path = "/system/health";
        options.ResponseWriter = WriteHealthCheckResponse;
    }));
```

When using the persistence builder, database health checks are automatically added for SQL Server and PostgreSQL databases:

```csharp
builder.Host.ConfigureEndatix(endatix => endatix
    .WithPersistence(db => db
        .UseSqlServer<AppDbContext>()));
```

### Skipping Health Checks

If you want to disable health checks entirely, you can use the `SkipHealthChecks` method:

```csharp
builder.Host.ConfigureEndatix(endatix => endatix
    .SkipHealthChecks());
