# Webhooks

Endatix provides a flexible webhook system that allows you to send notifications to external systems when specific events occur in your application. This guide will show you how to implement custom webhook handlers in an external assembly.

## Overview

Webhooks in Endatix are implemented as event handlers that process specific events and send them to configured webhook endpoints. The system supports various types of events, including:

- Form events (`FormCreated`, `FormUpdated`, `FormEnabledStateChanged`, `FormDeleted`)
- Submission events (`SubmissionCompleted`)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create a New Project

First, create a new class library project that will contain your webhook handlers:

```bash
dotnet new classlib -n YourCompany.Endatix.WebHooks
```

### 2. Add Required Dependencies

Add the following NuGet packages to your project:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    ...
    <PackageReference Include="Endatix.Core" Version="1.0.0" />
    ...
</ItemGroup>
```

### 3. Create Webhook Handlers

Create handlers for the events you want to process. Here's an example of a `FormCreated` event handler:

```csharp
using Endatix.Core.Abstractions;
using Endatix.Core.Events;
using Endatix.Core.Features.WebHooks;
using MediatR;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace YourCompany.Endatix.WebHooks.FormEventHandlers;

public class FormCreatedHandler(IWebHookService webHookService, ILogger<FormCreatedHandler> logger, IIdGenerator<long> idGenerator) : INotificationHandler<FormCreatedEvent>
{
    public async Task Handle(FormCreatedEvent notification, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        logger.LogInformation("Handling FormCreatedEvent for form {FormId}", notification.Form.Id);

        var form = new
        {
            formId = notification.Form.Id,
            tenantId = notification.Form.TenantId,
            name = notification.Form.Name,
            description = notification.Form.Description,
            isEnabled = notification.Form.IsEnabled,
            activeDefinitionId = notification.Form.ActiveDefinitionId,
            themeId = notification.Form.ThemeId,
            createdAt = notification.Form.CreatedAt,
            modifiedAt = notification.Form.ModifiedAt,
        };

        var message = new WebHookMessage<object>(
            idGenerator.CreateId(),
            WebHookOperation.FormCreated,
            form);

        await webHookService.EnqueueWebHookAsync(notification.Form.TenantId, message, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

You can find this example and others in the [Endatix.Samples.CustomEventHandlers](https://github.com/endatix/endatix/tree/main/samples/Endatix.Samples.CustomEventHandlers) project in the Endatix open source repository.

> **Note**: These are basic examples. Production code may include additional logging, should have proper error handling, etc.

### 4. Create an Assembly Reference

Create a static class to reference your assembly:

```csharp
namespace YourCompany.Endatix.WebHooks;

public static class AssemblyReference
{
    public static readonly Assembly Assembly = typeof(AssemblyReference).Assembly;
}
```

### 5. Register the Assembly in Endatix

First, add a project reference to your custom assembly in your Endatix application's project file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    ...
    <ProjectReference Include="../YourCompany.Endatix.WebHooks/YourCompany.Endatix.WebHooks.csproj" />
    ...
</ItemGroup>
```

Then, in your Endatix application's `Program.cs`, register your webhook handlers assembly:

```csharp
builder.Host.ConfigureEndatixWithDefaults(endatix =>
{
    endatix.Infrastructure.Messaging.AddAssembly(YourCompany.Endatix.WebHooks.AssemblyReference.Assembly);
});
```

> **Note**: If your Endatix application is configured with the basic `builder.Host.ConfigureEndatix()`, you need to change it to `ConfigureEndatixWithDefaults` as shown in the example above.

## Testing Webhooks

You can use [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to test your webhook implementation. This service provides a unique URL that you can use as your webhook endpoint. It will display all incoming requests in real-time, allowing you to:

- View the complete request payload
- Inspect headers
- See the exact format of the data being sent
- Test different event types
- Verify the webhook message structure

To test your webhooks:
1. Go to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)
2. Copy the unique URL provided
3. Configure this URL as your webhook endpoint in Endatix by adding it to your `appsettings.Development.json`:

```json
{
  ...
  "Endatix": {
    ...
    "WebHooks": {
      "Events": {
        "FormCreated": {
          "IsEnabled": true,
          "WebHookEndpoints": [
            {
              "Url": "https://webhook.site/your-unique-id",
              "Authentication": {
                "Type": "None"
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        "FormUpdated": {
          "IsEnabled": true,
          "WebHookEndpoints": [
            {
              "Url": "https://webhook.site/your-unique-id",
              "Authentication": {
                "Type": "None"
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        "FormEnabledStateChanged": {
          "IsEnabled": true,
          "WebHookEndpoints": [
            {
              "Url": "https://webhook.site/your-unique-id",
              "Authentication": {
                "Type": "None"
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        "SubmissionCompleted": {
          "IsEnabled": true,
          "WebHookEndpoints": [
            {
              "Url": "https://webhook.site/your-unique-id",
              "Authentication": {
                "Type": "None"
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        "FormDeleted": {
          "IsEnabled": true,
          "WebHookEndpoints": [
            {
              "Url": "https://webhook.site/your-unique-id",
              "Authentication": {
                "Type": "None"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

4. Trigger events in your application
5. View the incoming webhook requests on webhook.site

## Webhook Authentication

Endatix supports configurable authentication for securing your webhook endpoints. You can configure authentication per endpoint to match your API requirements.

### Authentication Types

#### 1. API Key Authentication (`ApiKey`)
Sends an API key in a custom header:

```json
{
  "Url": "https://api.example.com/webhooks",
  "Authentication": {
    "Type": "ApiKey",
    "ApiKeyHeader": "X-SURVEY-API-KEY",
    "ApiKey": "your-secret-api-key"
  }
}
```

#### 2. No Authentication (`None`)
No authentication headers are sent:

```json
{
  "Url": "https://api.example.com/webhooks",
  "Authentication": {
    "Type": "None"
  }
}
```

### Backward Compatibility

The existing `WebHookUrls` configuration is still supported for backward compatibility. URLs configured this way will be called without authentication:

```json
{
  "FormCreated": {
    "IsEnabled": true,
    "WebHookUrls": [
      "https://webhook.site/your-unique-id"
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also mix both approaches in the same event configuration:

```json
{
  "FormCreated": {
    "IsEnabled": true,
    "WebHookUrls": [
      "https://webhook.site/no-auth-endpoint"
    ],
    "WebHookEndpoints": [
      {
        "Url": "https://api.example.com/secure-endpoint",
        "Authentication": {
          "Type": "ApiKey",
          "ApiKeyHeader": "X-SURVEY-API-KEY",
          "ApiKey": "secret-key"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Available Events

### Form Events

- `FormCreatedEvent`: Triggered when a new form is created
  - Endpoints that can trigger the event:
    - `POST api/forms`
  - Useful for synchronizing form data with external systems or triggering notifications

- `FormUpdatedEvent`: Triggered when a form is updated
  - Endpoints that can trigger the event:
    - `PUT api/forms/{formId}`
    - `PATCH api/forms/{formId}`
  - This event is triggered when performing form update action even if all the data remains the same
  - Can be used to track form changes and update related systems

- `FormEnabledStateChangedEvent`: Triggered when a form's enabled state changes
  - Endpoints that can trigger the event:
    - `PUT api/forms/{formId}`
    - `PATCH api/forms/{formId}`
  - This event is triggered only when the value of `IsEnabled` field changes
  - Useful for managing form availability in external systems

- `FormDeletedEvent`: Triggered when a form is deleted
  - Endpoints that can trigger the event:
    - `DELETE api/forms/{formId}`
  - This event is triggered when a form is soft-deleted
  - Useful for cleaning up related data in external systems or triggering notifications

### Submission Events

- `SubmissionCompletedEvent`: Triggered when a form submission is completed
  - Endpoints that can trigger the event:
    - `POST api/forms/{formId}/submissions`
    - `PUT api/forms/{formId}/submissions/{submissionId}`
    - `PATCH api/forms/{formId}/submissions/{submissionId}`
    - `PATCH api/forms/{formId}/submissions/by-token/{submissionToken}`
  - This event is triggered once per submission when `IsComplete` field is set to true
  - Can be used to process form responses, trigger workflows, or update external systems

## Webhook Message Structure

Each webhook message contains:

- `Id`: Unique Snowflake-generated webhook message id
- `EventName`: The type of event (e.g., `form_created`, `form_updated`, `form_enabled_state_changed`, `form_deleted`, `submission_completed`)
- `Action`: The action that triggered the event (e.g., `created`, `updated`, `deleted`)
- `Payload`: The event data specific to the operation, containing the complete entity data. It includes explicit entity identifier fields, such as `formId` for form events and `submissionId` for submission events

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always implement proper error handling in your webhook handlers
2. **Logging**: Use logging to track webhook processing
3. **Idempotency**: Design your webhook handlers to be idempotent to handle potential duplicate deliveries
4. **Validation**: Validate the payload structure and required fields before processing
