# Hosting Configuration

This guide covers configuration options for Endatix applications using the builder pattern provided by the `Endatix.Hosting` package. For basic setup instructions, see the [Setup Using NuGet Package](/docs/getting-started/setup-nuget-package) guide.

## The Builder Pattern

Endatix.Hosting uses the builder pattern to provide a fluent, intuitive API for configuration. This pattern offers several advantages:

- **Modular configuration**: Configure only the components you need
- **Fluent API**: Chain method calls for a clean, readable configuration
- **Separation of concerns**: Each builder focuses on a specific aspect of the application
- **Type safety**: Strongly-typed configuration options with IntelliSense support

## Configuration Approaches

Endatix offers three approaches to service configuration:

### Approach 1: Simple Default Configuration

The simplest way to add Endatix to your application with sensible defaults:

```csharp
// Apply all defaults with minimal code
builder.Host.ConfigureEndatix();
```

This approach is perfect for getting started quickly or for applications that don't need custom configuration.

### Approach 2: Complete Custom Configuration

For maximum control over every aspect of Endatix, configure only what you need:

```csharp
// Configure only the components you need
builder.Host.ConfigureEndatix(endatix => {
    // Configure Endatix using various builder methods
    // This is where you would add all your custom configuration
});
```

This approach gives you complete control over what gets configured and how.

### Approach 3: Hybrid Configuration

For a balanced approach, start with defaults and customize only what you need:

```csharp
// Start with defaults, then customize specific parts
builder.Host.ConfigureEndatixWithDefaults(endatix => {
    // Customize specific components after applying defaults
});
```

This approach provides the best of both worlds - sensible defaults with selective customization.

## Middleware Registration

After configuring your services, register the Endatix middleware in your application:

```csharp
var app = builder.Build();

// Add Endatix middleware with default configuration
app.UseEndatix();

app.Run();
```

## What's Included in the Default Setup

When you use `builder.Host.ConfigureEndatix()`, the following features are automatically configured with sensible defaults:

- **API endpoints**
- **Authentication and authorization**
- **Database persistence**
- **Logging**

The specific implementation details of these components are subject to change as the framework evolves.

## Next Steps

As Endatix continues to develop, future versions will provide more detailed configuration options for each component. For now, the recommended approach is to use the default configuration unless you have specific requirements that need customization.
