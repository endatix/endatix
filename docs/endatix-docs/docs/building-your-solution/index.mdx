# Building Your Solution

Endatix offers a comprehensive framework for crafting form-centric data driven solutions, focusing on user input collection and data processing. This guide will take you through building your solution and customizing the key features, so you can meet your unique requirements.

This section and its pages are structured to guide you through the process of integrating Endatix features into your application, from the basics to advanced configurations. You can follow the guides sequentially or jump directly to the topics most relevant to your project.

If you're new to Endatix, we recommend starting with the sections on [Setup](/getting-started/setup-docker.md), [Architecture](/getting-started/architecture.md), [Form Creation with SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/create-free-survey), as they introduce the fundamental Endatix concepts and principles for building form-centric data driven solutions. Then, you can explore the other sections such as Data Validation, Workflow Integration, and Reporting. Finally, once you're ready, explore the sections on Deployment and Maintenance.
