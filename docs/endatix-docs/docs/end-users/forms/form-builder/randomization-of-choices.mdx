# **Randomization of Choices for Choice-based Questions**

Endatix Hub provides granular control over how options are presented to respondents. Beyond simple shuffling, you can **exclude specific items** from randomization or **group choices together** to ensure related options stay as a cohesive unit while still being randomized as a block.

This feature enables you to eliminate order bias without sacrificing the contextual integrity of your lists.

## **Key Capabilities**

* **Selective Shuffling:** Enable randomization for the whole question but "pin" specific items to their original position.
* **Logical Grouping:** Assign choices to a "Group". All items within a group will move together during the shuffle.
* **Mixed Ordering:** Combine fixed items, randomized individual items, and randomized groups within a single question.

This feature applies to all choice-based question types, including:

* **Radio group** (Single Choice)
* **Check boxes** (Multiple Choice)
* **Multi-select Dropdown** (Multiple Choice)
* **Dropdown** (Single Choice)
* **Image Picker** (Multiple Choice)
* **Ranking**

## **Configuration Guide**

To access advanced randomization, you must first enable the general randomization setting for the question.

### **1. Enable Randomization**

In the **Property Grid**, locate the **Choice order** dropdown and select **Random**.

{/* [Screenshot: Selection of 'Random' in the 'Choice order' dropdown at the bottom of the property grid] */}

### **2. Configure Choice Options**

Once **Random** is selected, two new columns appear in the **Choices** editor table: **Randomize** and **Group**.

{/* [Screenshot: The Choice Options modal showing 'Randomize' checkboxes and 'Group' text inputs] */}

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Randomize** | A checkbox determining if this specific item should be shuffled. If unchecked, the item stays in its defined position. |
| **Group** | A text identifier. Items with the same Group ID (e.g., "A") will be treated as a single block. |

## **How it Works**

The Endatix randomization engine follows a specific logic to determine the final display order:

1. **Group Identification:** The engine looks for items sharing the same `group` value.
2. **Block Preservation:** If a group of items is set to randomize, they are shuffled **internally** within their group, but they stay together in the list.
3. **Sticky Items:** Items where `randomize` is set to `false` (like "None of the above") will remain exactly where you placed them in the editor, regardless of the shuffle.

### **Example Scenario**

Imagine you are listing shoe brands. You want to group brands by Category (Group A and Group B) but keep "Reebok" at a fixed position.

* **Group A (Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi, 7UP Zero Sugar):** These three will shuffle amongst themselves but remain as a block, preserving the context of sugar-free drinks.
* **Other (Sugar-free):** By unchecking the "Randomize" box, this one will always appear in the 4th position.
* **Group B (Dr. Pepper, Fanta, Mountain Dew):** These will shuffle amongst themselves but remain as a block, preserving the context of regular drinks.
* **Other (Regular):** By unchecking the "Randomize" box, this one will always appear in the last position.


## **Technical Reference (JSON Schema)**

Advanced users can define these behaviors directly in the JSON schema using the `randomize` (boolean) and `group` (string) properties within the `choices` array.

```json
{
  "type": "radiogroup",
  "name": "brand_preference",
  "choices": [
    {
      "value": "nike",
      "text": "Nike",
      "group": "A"
    },
    {
      "value": "adidas",
      "text": "Adidas",
      "group": "A"
    },
    {
      "value": "reebok",
      "text": "Reebok",
      "randomize": false
    }
  ],
  "choicesOrder": "random"
}

```
