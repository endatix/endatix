# What is Endatix?

Endatix Platform is an open-source data collection and management library for .NET.

:::tip

If you just want to see how to install the platform and read about it later, please go to [Setup Using NuGet Package](/docs/getting-started/setup-nuget-package.md) or [Setup Using Docker](/docs/getting-started/setup-docker.md).

:::

It is designed for building secure, scalable, and integrated form-centric applications that work with [SurveyJS](https://github.com/surveyjs/survey-library). Endatix empowers business users with advanced workflows, automation, and meaningful insights.

The platform provides the necessary backend solution for end-to-end data management:
- defining and managing complex SurveyJS forms
- integrating them into software products
- collecting and storing the data
- processing the collected data

Endatix can be seamlessly integrated into a software product or used as a standalone product.
