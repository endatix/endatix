# Endatix.Modules.Reporting

Reporting bounded context for BI-ready survey exports.

>[!TIP]
>**[Endatix Platform](https://github.com/endatix/endatix)** is an open-source data collection and management library for .NET. It is designed for building secure, scalable, and integrated form-centric applications that work with SurveyJS. Endatix empowers business users with advanced workflows, automation, and meaningful insights.

## Installation:

```bash
dotnet add package Endatix.Modules.Reporting
```

## Recommended Usage:

For running and hosting the Endatix Platform, **Endatix.Api.Host** is the recommended main package as it simplifies the installation and setup process.

```bash
dotnet add package Endatix.Api.Host
```

The module is registered automatically by `EndatixBuilder.UseDefaults()` — no host code change is needed to get it, and none is needed to keep it off. Availability is decided at runtime by the feature flag (see [Registration](#registration)), not by whether the package is present.

## Module layout (Modulith)

Packaging (what is public vs what stays in the module): [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md#module-packaging-contracts-vs-domain).

Integration pipeline state lives on `FlattenedSubmission` in the `reporting` schema. A future reporting read API can expose `SubmissionIntegrationSnapshotDto` per submission without touching core `Submission` list endpoints.

## Schema

Database schema: `reporting`

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `FormSchemas` | Compiled form schema (`FlatteningMap` + `Codebook`) per tenant + form |
| `FlattenedSubmissions` | Flat submission answers aligned to form schema |
| `ExportFormats` | Tenant export rows (CSV, JSON, Excel/XLSX, codebook) |
| `SurveyTypeExportMappings` | Allowed export formats per survey type (with optional default and tenant fallback) |

`FlattenedSubmissions.SubmissionId` is the row key. Backfill and the completion outbox both update that row; they do not insert a second one.

`POST …/reporting/submissions/backfill` pages one scope per call. Omitted `completionScope` is `completed`. `incomplete` flattens drafts. The outbox still skips drafts. A processed row is skipped when the submission's `ModifiedAt ?? CreatedAt` is not newer than the row's `SourceModifiedAt` (the stamp of the version that was flattened), unless `force` is true. The row's own `ModifiedAt` is not used: the worker sets it after reading the submission, so a save during flattening would look older and never be refreshed. Rows without `SourceModifiedAt` (processed before it existed) are reprocessed once. A flatten whose submission is gone marks an existing row deleted only when the submission was soft-deleted in the same tenant and form; otherwise it throws, so the outbox retries and backfill reports it as failed. With background jobs on (`Endatix:Outbox:DeliverToJobQueue`), the flatten job retries instead and then dead-letters. A submission deleted after the flatten read it loses the row the flatten wrote, hard-deleted as its deletion sync removes it. Export drops soft-deleted submissions.

Flattens of one submission can run out of order, as retries or as jobs, so each write is guarded by `SourceRevision`: the submission's `Revision` the row was written from. A write lands only when the row has no `SourceRevision` or one not newer than the write's, so an older flatten finishing last changes nothing, and a forced rebuild at the same revision still lands. `SourceRevision` orders writes; `SourceModifiedAt` only tells backfill whether a row is stale. A draft's saves raise no events and so share one revision: among them, the last flatten to write wins.

### FormSchema compile modes

On every compile path (outbox `form.definition.updated`, manual `POST .../reporting/compile-schema`):

| Mode | When | Behavior |
|------|------|----------|
| **Replace** | Form has **0 real** submissions (`IsTestSubmission == false`) and the definition is not older than the schema's revision; or `replace=true` | Rebuild FlatteningMap + Codebook from the definition only, at its revision. After save, hard-delete that form’s `FlattenedSubmissions` rows (test flatten debris). |
| **Merge** | Form has **≥1 real** submission, or the definition is older than the schema's revision | Append-only merge: retain historical columns, questions, and choice-catalog values. |

Test submissions alone do **not** force merge. This is a defensive bridge until Form Publish makes publish the controlled compile moment.

Rebuilds of one form run one at a time. Each reads the schema, chooses its mode, compiles and saves in one transaction holding the form's transaction lock (`ITransactionLock`, scope `TransactionLockScopes.ReportingFormSchema`, key `{tenantId}:{formId}`; on PostgreSQL `pg_advisory_xact_lock(scope, hashtext(key))`), so a rebuild that waited decides on what the one before it saved. Without it, two rebuilds that read the schema at once each saved only their own columns, and the revision still looked current.

- **Decided under the lock.** The mode is chosen from the schema as read under the lock. A definition older than the schema only merges, adding the columns the schema lacks, and changes nothing when it lacks none, so it never drops a newer definition's columns. The real-submission count is read before the lock; a zero, which would replace, is read again under it.
- **A waiter that finds the work done stops.** A flatten that needs a definition's columns stops when the schema is at that definition's revision or newer and has them. A compile after a definition changed still compiles, as the definition may have been edited in place under the same id, but saves nothing, and clears no rows, when the result is what is stored.
- **What runs under the lock:** the schema read, the mode choice, the real-submission count for a replace, the compile, the save, and for a replace the clearing of the flattened rows. The definition read, the first count, the definition's columns, and the form-deleted check run outside it. After the commit the definition is read again, and a rebuild that compiled JSON an in-place edit has since replaced runs once more.
- **The wait is bounded at 10 seconds** (`lock_timeout` for the lock alone, under the 30-second default command timeout). A wait that runs out throws `TransactionLockTimeoutException`; a job retries it, and a backfill reports the submission as failed and processes it on its next run.
- **SQL Server:** there is no transaction lock yet; a rebuild there throws `NotSupportedException` when it asks for one.

Whether the schema has an older definition's columns is worked out once per scope for each saved version of the schema (`FormSchemaCoverage`).

A flatten rebuilds the schema only for a submission on a definition newer than the schema's revision, or on an older one whose columns the schema lacks (a replace dropped them). A merge keeps every column, so an older definition is normally already in the schema; rebuilding from it would save the schema again for every such submission and put the older definition's labels and locales back.

A form deleted after a compile read it loses the schema that compile wrote, hard-deleted as its deletion sync removes it.

## Registration

Registered via `EndatixBuilder.UseDefaults()` → `UseModule(ReportingModule.Instance)`. Capabilities: `IEndatixModule`, `IHasFeatureFlag`, `IHasDbMigrations`, `IHasFastEndpoints` (serializers/OpenAPI tags via `ConfigureFastEndpoints`). Do **not** also `Api.ScanAssemblies` this assembly. `ReportingPersistence.ConfigureDbContextOptions` sets both namespaces, but **runtime requires PostgreSQL** until [#813](https://github.com/endatix/endatix/issues/813) (no SQL Server migrations; auto-migrate does not create `reporting`). Disabled by default until:

```json
"Endatix": {
  "FeatureFlags": {
    "ReportingModule": true
  }
}
```

## Migrations

Run the commands from the `oss` folder.

> [!NOTE]
> Always use `Endatix.WebHost` as startup project, and this module as the migrations project (`ReportingDbContext`).
> Set `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection_DbProvider` to the provider you are generating for.

Migrations live in provider-specific subfolders under `Persistence/Migrations/`:

- `Persistence/Migrations/PostgreSql/` — **available** (`InitialReporting`, `SeedDefaultExportFormats`, `AddFlattenedSubmissionSourceModifiedAt`, `AddFlattenedSubmissionSourceRevision`)

  Tenant export formats are rows, not code. Runtime catalog: `DefaultExportFormats.All`
  (`SeedDefaultsAsync` / `tenant.created`). **Existing tenants:** frozen SQL in
  `SeedDefaultExportFormats` — do not generate that migration from the catalog; a new default
  needs a new data migration. **New tenants:** outbox `tenant.created` → `IDefaultExportFormatsSeeder`.
- `Persistence/Migrations/SqlServer/` — **not yet available**. SQL Server support is coming soon
  ([endatix/endatix#813](https://github.com/endatix/endatix/issues/813)). Use PostgreSQL for Reporting until then.

> **SQL Server hosts:** Do not enable `ReportingModule` with `Endatix:Data:EnableAutoMigrations` until SQL Server
> migrations land in #813. The module DbContext and migration contributor register on SQL Server, but startup
> auto-migration finds no migrations for the active provider and logs an error (the `reporting` schema is not created).

Startup also applies Reporting migrations when `Customizations:Reporting:ApplyMigrationsAtStartup` is true (default)
and `Endatix:Data:EnableAutoMigrations` is enabled.

### Add migration

PostgreSQL only (SQL Server: wait for #813).

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName> \
  --startup-project src/Endatix.WebHost \
  --project src/Endatix.Modules.Reporting \
  --context ReportingDbContext \
  --output-dir Persistence/Migrations/PostgreSql
```

### Remove last migration

1. List migrations and check whether the last one is already applied locally:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations list \
  --startup-project src/Endatix.WebHost \
  --project src/Endatix.Modules.Reporting \
  --context ReportingDbContext
```

2. If it is applied, roll the database back to the previous migration:

```bash
dotnet ef database update <PreviousMigrationName> \
  --startup-project src/Endatix.WebHost \
  --project src/Endatix.Modules.Reporting \
  --context ReportingDbContext
```

3. Remove the last migration:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations remove \
  --startup-project src/Endatix.WebHost \
  --project src/Endatix.Modules.Reporting \
  --context ReportingDbContext
```

### Apply migrations

```bash
dotnet ef database update \
  --startup-project src/Endatix.WebHost \
  --project src/Endatix.Modules.Reporting \
  --context ReportingDbContext
```
